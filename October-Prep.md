# OCTOBER 6th-31st: Prep
 Upper/Lower split 3/4 days a week, fasting/cutting & less dialed in with lifting but fairly consistent.

## SPLIT
 This month I used an alternating upper lower split with a rest day between every lift.

| Week | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun | # Lifts |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| 1    | U   | R   | L   | R   | U   | R   | L   | 4       |
| 2    | R   | U   | R   | L   | R   | U   | R   | 3       |
| 3    | L   | R   | U   | R   | L   | R   | U   | 4       |
| 4    | R   | L   | R   | U   | R   | L   | R   | 3       |

Goal: slowly get used to higher volume/intensity workouts

## ROUTINES
 I made 3 variations of the upper routine and 2 of the lower to minimize frequency.
 The reduced freauency helps avoid overuse in my build up Phase.

#### FORMAT
* Exercise \#sets x \#reps
  * Suoerset

### Upper
 Upper routines are bodybuilding focused with the goal of rounding out weak points.
 For strength I am focused mainly on incline bench, pull-ups, and weighted chin-ups.
 Biceps, upper chest, back, and shoulders are key focuses from an aesthetics point of view.
 When winter starts I will drop the volume to start ramping up intensity. (perhaps 2 strength 1 aesthtic day)

#### UPPER A
* Push-Ups
* Pull-Ups
* Behind The Neck Press
* Single Arm DB Row
* Tricep Rope Pushdown
* Incline/Preacher Curl

#### Upper B
* Dumbbell Pullover
* Incline Bench
* Bent Over Row
* Lateral Raise
* Alternating DB Curl
* Single Arm Cable Pushdown

#### Upper C
* KB/MedBall Halo
* Weighted Chin-Up
* EZ Bar Miracle Gro
  * EZ Bar Close Grip Bench
* Rear Delt Fly
* Hammer Curl

### Lower
 My lower routins are intentionally as simple as possible.
 The main goal is to safely re-develop my strength on squat and deadlift.
 I am limiting volume to focus on improving my technique while steadily raising the intensity.
 I also am implimenting regimented low impact/intensity cardio on these days to improve my base fitness level.

#### Lower A
* Squat
* KB Swings
* 15-30 Min Stairs

#### Lower B
* Deadlift
* Leg/Knee Raise
* 15-30 Min Incline Walk
